## Window Manager
I started this project by creating the main app file which will handle rendering the GUI through the Window Manager. This class also handles the calling of the Geometry Manager.

## Geometry manager
This portion of the app handles the placement and contents of various widgets for the GUI.

## Closing Thoughts
This project was a great way to exercise my GUI creation abilities and use of various widgets. If I were to expand this in the future, I would like to add the ablity to store a students full schedule with names of teachers for each class as well as other information like: grade level, GPA, and possibly individual class grades.
